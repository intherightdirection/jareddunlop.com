          <div class="half-width">
            <p>
              A resident of Ontario, Canada, I am a kind and humble Canadian. 
              My journey into the world of tech has been seemingly all over the 
              map which has made me pretty well rounded, a generalist. I was always
              more interested in being a builder. Finding myself drawn to programming,
              I found my place concentrating on web development.

            <p>
              Being a lifelong learner has always been important to me. I am a 
              lover of knowledge, and one of those people that tries to learn 
              everything there is to know about certain things. I guess that is 
              threatening to some competitive people but I barely have a 
              competitive bone in my body. I'd say I am more anti-competitive and 
              just like to focus on what I am doing or being.

            <h3>Hands-On<br>
              Code</h3>
            
            <p>As far as development goes, I am more of a hands on Artisian that 
              can do custom modifications. As someone that likes to learn deeply, 
              I am able to better manipulate inanimate things</p>

            <h3>Full Stack Development</h3>

            <p>Being a person oriented individual I focus on user experience which 
            encompasses everything from user interfaces to and back end servers. 
            No one can do everything effectively by them selves, so I do
            work with others who focus better in specific areas, especially 
            in graphic design, not being a visual designer.

            <h3>Get Your Visuals on the Web</h3>

            <p>I do have my own designer contacts. If you have a designer or if 
              you yourself are a designer, I'd love to work with you and what you have. 
              Provide me a design and I will get it in the digital web world.</p>
